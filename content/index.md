## Hi
I'm [Sidney](https://github.com/sidney-eliot), a 3D character artist, and this knowledge pool is for me, you, and everyone else.


> [!info]- More about this handbook
>
> I’m a self-taught artist, and I know just how difficult it can be to piece together a variety of snippets from various sources in an effort to get a complete picture. So, I made this handbook to cover the entire workflow, as well as other things, like composition, character design theory, anatomy, and more. I’m not saying that this is the end-all-be-all, but it can definitely be your main support line, which you can compliment with a bit of your own research.
> 
> My goal with this handbook isn’t to cover entry level stuff. Rather, the methods and workflows I explore are mainly industry standard; following them will yield great results. A perfect example of this would be the [[baking| baking]] page, in which I demonstrate how even amazing studios, like Riot Games, don’t always have the best approaches to difficult problems.

This is probably best suited for intermediate and advanced 3D artists. If you're a 2D artist, then you might find something interesting [[#All Things from This Handbook Relevant for 2D Artists|here]]. My 3D workflow mostly consists of the following software: [Blender](https://www.blender.org/features/), [ZBrush](https://pixologic.com/), [Marmoset Toolbag](https://marmoset.co/toolbag/), [Substance Painter](https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d-painter.html), [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) and [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/features). Therefore, this handbook will cover workflows in the software listed above, but many of the concepts are universal and can be applied to other software, as well.

If you don't understand a term, give the [[glossary|glossary]] a visit.
